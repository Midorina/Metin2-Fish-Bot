# Mt2 Classic Fishing Bot

Was made for Mt2 Classic server. It reads the game's memory to understand whether a fish is caught or not. 
If you also use the item which shows the name of the caught fish, 
it will use the best possible time to pull the pole (data is extracted from game's source code).

I was in the process of making a captcha solver, 
by generating millions of captcha images and feeding it into a convolutional neural network, 
but then stopped playing the game.
